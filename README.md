# portfolio-optimiser


Description: 
This term project is to help investment portfolio management. My application can take assets’ historical data of last 3 years from web, and provide predicted excess returns of risky assets by regression analysis between excess returns of individual assets and S&P 500 index.
This project can also take whatever assets the users chose in their portfolio, and generate the expected returns, volatility, and return risk ratio on the portfolio level, based on any weights of each asset. To optimize the portfolio’s capital allocation, my application can also generate the optimal weights to achieve minimal risk, and the maximum return risk ratio (portfolio excess return/volatility) as investment advice. This is a practical application of Efficient Frontier and Capital Allocation Line theories in finance.
